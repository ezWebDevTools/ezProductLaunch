Packaging, as in product packaging. As in addional details. As in the things that are important to a product beyond just the product itself.

Put your product's version of ezProductLaunch in a folder named /packaging/. Or call it whatever you want. Packaging makes the most sense to us :) 

In your regular README recommend they see /packaging/ for more details.
